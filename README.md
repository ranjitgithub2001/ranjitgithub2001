# 👋 Hey there, I’m Ranjit Kale  

✨ I’m a **trainer at FBS**, where I get to share my love for coding and tech with students.  
🚀 I enjoy diving into **Java, JavaScript, React.js, Spring Boot**, and exploring new tools that make development fun.  
🎨 On the frontend, I like working with **HTML5 | CSS3 | TailwindCSS** to bring ideas to life.  
🤝 Always excited to **collaborate on web development projects** and learn from others along the way.

😄 **Pronouns:** He/Him  
⚡ **Fun fact:** When I’m not teaching or coding, you’ll probably find me writing poems in **Hindi & Urdu** or enjoying a good podcast.  

💡 *I love helping others grow in tech while growing myself.*
